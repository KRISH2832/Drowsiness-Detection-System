Introduction-
This GitHub repository houses the code and resources for a Drowsiness Detection System and Virtual Bumper for road vehicles. These advanced safety features aim to enhance driver alertness, reduce the risk of accidents, and prevent speed-related collisions. By implementing these technologies, we aim to improve road safety, minimize accidents, and reduce associated legal and insurance costs.

Drowsiness Detection System-
A drowsiness detection system is designed to monitor driver behavior, typically through cameras or sensors, in order to identify signs of fatigue. Here are some key benefits of implementing such a system:

1.	Reducing the risk of accidents caused by drowsy driving.
2.	Minimizing fatalities and injuries, leading to fewer legal and insurance costs for businesses.
3.	Increasing productivity and operational efficiency by ensuring driver alertness in commercial fleets.
4.	Enhancing brand reputation and customer trust through a commitment to safety.
5.	Potentially reducing insurance premiums for businesses with safer driving records.

Virtual Bumper-
A virtual bumper is a safety feature that uses sensors and algorithms to detect instances of error during driving and autonomously applies brakes or reduces speed to avoid accidents. Here are the advantages of implementing a virtual bumper system:

1.	Actively monitors and manages vehicle speeds, reducing the likelihood of high-speed accidents.
2.	Swiftly detects speed-related collisions, minimizing the severity of impacts and decreasing the risk of fatalities and severe injuries.
3.	Fewer speed-related accidents mean lower legal and insurance costs for businesses, leading to significant cost savings.
4.	Demonstrates a commitment to preventing speed-related accidents, enhancing a company's reputation for safety and responsibility.
5.	Ensures the system's effectiveness in speed-related accident prevention, supporting uninterrupted business operations and long-term sustainability.







Technology Stack-
The Drowsiness Detection System and Virtual Bumper utilize the following technologies and tools:

OpenCV: Used for gathering images from webcams, which are essential for monitoring driver behavior.

AI Data Feeding and Training: A dataset of 2900+ images of people's eyes under different lighting conditions is used for training the Drowsiness Detection System.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): The CNN architecture is employed, consisting of input, output, and hidden layers, for accurate drowsiness detection.

Python: Knowledge of Python, including its basic syntax and structure, is required for working with the code.

TensorFlow: Used for the backend of the project, providing the framework for implementing neural networks.

Keras: Utilized for the classification aspect of the project, enabling efficient model training and evaluation.

Pygame: Utilized for playing alarm noises when drowsiness is detected, alerting the driver.

EGM (Ephemeral Grid Mapping): Employed for the virtual bumper functionality, enhancing collision avoidance capabilities.
